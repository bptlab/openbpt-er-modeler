# openbpt-modeler-template

Template repository for the creation of modelers used in the OpenBPT project.
The template is a generalization of the [ptn-js](https://github.com/MaximilianKoenig/ptn-js) modeler. It is based on [diagram-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js) and took inspiration from [bpmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js), [object-diagram-js](https://github.com/timKraeuter/object-diagram-js) and [fcm-js](https://github.com/bptlab/fCM-design-support).

The template showcases a working version of a basic Petri net modeler whose elements should be replaced with the elements of the new modeling language. For that purpose, fork the repository and follow the steps outlined below.
**If you create a new modeler and implement additional features that could be generalized to fit any modeler, please feel free to create a pull request so that other may profit from your extension as well!**

## Development Setup

- link to demo-repo
- use npm link

## Implementing a New Modeler

Implementing a new modeler requires the definition of the metamodel of the modeling language, a custom renderer, a set of icons, and a few adaptations in the modeler itself. In general, the keyword **CustomModelerTodo** marks places in the code that require adaptation.
